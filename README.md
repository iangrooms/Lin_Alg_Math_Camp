# Linear Algebra Math Camp

This repository contains materials developed by Ian Grooms for the math camp in Linear Algebra & Computing at CU-Boulder's Department of Applied Mathematics for incoming PhD students.
The material is drawn in part from the second edition of Applied Linear Algebra by Olver & Shakiban.
Other useful references include Matrix Analysis and Applied Linear Algebra by Carl Meyer, and Matrix Analysis by Horn & Johnson.
